# DS_Individual_Project_Dylan-OBrien
In this project, I will be using a recipe dataset to make inferences and predictions based on included data and some user input. You can find the full report in the file Report (.docx file). All datasets, graph and codes are included in the corresponding folders.

Requirement of the individual Project:

Reports in the folder report:
  - Must use the provided report template. You can download it in BrightSpace -> Content -> Individual_Project -> Report_Template.docx
  - Must submit both word and PdF format of the report

Folders:
  - Graph folder: contain all pics in the report
  - Codes folder: contain the Jupyter notebook coding file.
  - Dataset folder: contain all datasets files. The name of data file should be consistent with the read data functions in the coding file
